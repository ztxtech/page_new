# ðŸ˜Š About Me

Greetings, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, with an anticipated graduation date of `June 2026`. My research focuses on the fields of **time series analysis, statistical physics, information theory, and uncertainty theory**. I am deeply passionate about exploring the intersections within these disciplines and addressing the complex challenges they present.

I am actively _seeking a **fully-funded Ph.D. position** in Computer Science_, where I hope to join a vibrant research community and collaborate with like-minded scholars in pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. If my research interests align with yours, or if you see potential for a research collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me via email.

I look forward to connecting with you and am excited about the prospect of collectively advancing the field of science.
