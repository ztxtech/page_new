# 👋 Hello, I'm Tianxiang

## 🎓 **Academic Background & Research Interests**

I am currently a Master student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I expect to graduate in June 2026. My research interest mainly centers on **Time Series Analysis**. I pay close attention to **Foundation Models** and **Representation Learning**. I try to understand the intrinsic nature of data through **Statistical Physics** and **Information Theory**. I also work on **Uncertainty Theory** to make models more reliable. I believe that a good model should handle data noise and concept drift well. I aim to solve real world problems with robust algorithms 🚀.

## 🌟 **Experience & Future Goal**

I also care about how to use these methods in specific domains. I have strong interests in **Spatio-temporal Data** and **Medical Healthcare** and **Quantitative Finance**. I have worked as a research intern at **Griffith University** and **University of Macau**. I also serve as a research fellow at **[PyPOTS](https://pypots.com/)** because I enjoy coding and sharing [my code 💻](https://github.com/ztxtech/). I am now actively looking for a **Fully Funded Ph.D. Position**. I hope to join a team where I can continue my research on time series. Please feel free to contact me via email if you are interested in my profile 📧.
